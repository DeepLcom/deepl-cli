## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Watch Mode**: Real-time file/directory monitoring with auto-translation
  - Monitor files or directories for changes with `deepl watch`
  - Configurable debouncing (default 300ms)
  - Glob pattern filtering (e.g., `*.md`, `*.json`)
  - Multiple target languages support
  - Auto-commit to git (optional with `--auto-commit`)
  - Custom output directories
  - Statistics tracking and graceful shutdown
  - 19 comprehensive unit tests
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel directory translation
  - Translate entire directories with progress indicators
  - Configurable concurrency (default: 5, customizable with `--concurrency`)
  - Glob pattern filtering with `--pattern` option
  - Recursive/non-recursive modes with `--recursive`
  - Error recovery and detailed statistics
  - 16 unit tests for batch translation service
- **Context-Aware Translation**: Enhanced translation quality
  - New `--context` parameter for better disambiguation
  - Pass surrounding context to DeepL API
  - 5 additional tests for context handling

### Changed
- **CLI Commands**: Added new options to `translate` command
  - `--context <text>` - Additional context for better translation
  - `--recursive` - Process subdirectories (default: true)
  - `--pattern <glob>` - Filter files by glob pattern
  - `--concurrency <number>` - Control parallel translation count
- **Testing**: Expanded test suite from 302 to 380 tests
  - Unit tests: 275 → 316 tests
  - Integration tests: 27 tests (stable)
  - E2E tests: 21 tests (stable)
  - Overall pass rate: 97.9% (372 passing, 8 skipped)
- **Coverage**: Improved from 88.85% to 89.91%
- **Dependencies**: Added chokidar, p-limit, fast-glob for Phase 2 features

### Technical
- **WatchService**: New service for file monitoring with chokidar integration
- **BatchTranslationService**: Parallel processing with error recovery
- **Architecture**: Enhanced service layer with watch and batch capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized with parallel processing and smart caching

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Core Translation**: Text and file translation via DeepL API
- **Multi-language Support**: Translate to multiple target languages in one command
- **File Translation**: Support for `.txt` and `.md` files with format preservation
- **stdin Support**: Pipe text input for translation workflows
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management with config storage
- **Configuration**: Persistent configuration with `~/.deepl-cli/config.json`
- **Caching**: SQLite-based translation cache with LRU eviction
- **Glossary Management**: Create, list, and manage DeepL glossaries
- **CLI Commands**:
  - `deepl translate` - Translate text or files
  - `deepl auth` - Manage API keys (set-key, show, clear)
  - `deepl config` - Configuration management (get, set, list, reset)
  - `deepl cache` - Cache management (stats, clear, enable, disable)
  - `deepl glossary` - Glossary operations (create, list, show, entries, delete)

### Technical
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with 88.85% test coverage
- **Testing**: 275 unit tests, 27 integration tests (302 total)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation (CLI → Services → API → Storage)
- **Dependencies**: axios, better-sqlite3, commander, chalk
- **Node**: Requires Node >=18.0.0

### Notes
- Initial baseline release capturing Phase 1 MVP functionality
- Pre-1.0 version indicates API may change as we implement Phase 2-3 features
- Manual testing completed with real DeepL API - all features working
