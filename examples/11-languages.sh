echo "💡 Language listing benefits:"
echo "   - Discover all available languages"
echo "   - Check source vs target language differences"
echo "   - Validate language codes before translation"
echo "   - Script-friendly output for automation"
echo

echo "📚 Language notes:"
echo "   - Source languages: Languages you can translate FROM"
echo "   - Target languages: Languages you can translate TO"
echo "   - Some languages only available as targets (e.g., en-us, en-gb)"
echo "   - Language codes are case-insensitive in CLI commands"
echo

echo "🔍 Common language codes:"
echo "   - en: English (source only)"
echo "   - en-us: English (American) - target only"
echo "   - en-gb: English (British) - target only"
echo "   - de: German"
