echo "=== Git Hooks Features ==="
echo
echo "Available hooks:"
echo "  • pre-commit: Validates translations before each commit"
echo "  • pre-push: Validates all translations before pushing to remote"
echo "  • commit-msg: Validates or enriches commit messages with translation metadata"
echo "  • post-commit: Automatically triggers translation of changed files after each commit"
echo
echo "Hook behavior:"
echo "  • Checks translation file pairs (e.g., README.md + README.es.md)"
echo "  • Validates that translations are in sync with source"
echo "  • Blocks commit/push if validation fails"
echo "  • Provides clear error messages for fixing issues"
echo
echo "Installation safety:"
echo "  • Automatically backs up existing hooks"
echo "  • Won't overwrite custom hooks without backup"
echo "  • Easy uninstallation without data loss"
echo
echo "Management commands:"
echo "  • deepl hooks install <type>   - Install a hook"
echo "  • deepl hooks uninstall <type> - Remove a hook"
echo "  • deepl hooks list             - Show all hooks status"
echo "  • deepl hooks path <type>      - Show hook file location"
echo
echo "💡 Use cases:"
echo "  • Enforce translation quality before commits"
echo "  • Prevent pushing incomplete translations"
echo "  • Automate translation validation in team workflows"
echo "  • Integrate with CI/CD pipelines"
echo "  • Maintain consistency across localized content"
echo
echo "⚙️  Customization:"
echo "  • Hook scripts are customizable shell files"
echo "  • Located in .git/hooks/"
echo "  • Can be modified for project-specific workflows"
echo "  • Integrate with other git hooks if needed"
echo
echo "🔒 Team collaboration:"
echo "  • Each developer installs hooks locally"
echo "  • Provides consistent validation across team"
echo "  • Catches translation issues early"
echo "  • Reduces manual translation review burden"
